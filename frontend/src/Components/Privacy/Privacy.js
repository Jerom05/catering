          c.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From Cookies.
          &nbsp;Information that we collect using “cookie” technology.
          &nbsp;Cookies are small packets of data that a website stores on your
          computer’s or mobile device’s hard drive so that your computer will
          “remember” information about your visit. 
          <p></p>
          &nbsp;We may use both session
          cookies (which expire once you close your web browser) and persistent
          cookies (which stay on your computer until you delete them) to help us
          collect Other Information and to enhance your experience using the
          Site or the Services. 
          <p></p>
          &nbsp;If you do not want us to place a cookie on
          your hard drive, you may be able to turn that feature off on your
          computer or mobile device. 
          <p></p>
          &nbsp;Please consult your Internet
          browser’s documentation for information on how to do this and how to
          delete persistent cookies. 
          <p></p>
          &nbsp;However, if you decide not to accept
          cookies from us, the Site or the Services may not function properly.
          Accessing and Modifying Personal Information and Communication
          Preferences If you are a Registered User, you may access, review, and
          make changes to your Personal Information, certain Other Information,
          and, if applicable, Billing Information by following the instructions
          found on the Site. 
          <p></p>
          &nbsp;In addition, you may manage your receipt of
          marketing and non-transactional communications by clicking on the
          “unsubscribe” link located on the bottom of any Baanthai marketing
          email. 
          <p></p>
          &nbsp;Registered Users cannot opt out of receiving
          transactional e-mails related to their account. 
          <p></p>
          &nbsp;We will use
          commercially reasonable efforts to process such requests in a timely
          manner.
          <p></p>
           &nbsp;You should be aware, however, that it is not always
          possible to completely remove or modify information in our
          subscription databases. How We Use and Share the Information We use
          the Personal Information and the Other Information (collectively, the
          “Information”) to provide the Services; to maintain and improve our
          Site and Services; to solicit your feedback; and to inform you about
          our products and services and those of our third-party marketing
          partners. We may also use and/or share Information as described below.
          ⦁ Baanthai will access, use, and share the Information as required to
          process your orders, provide support to you, and monitor compliance
          with our Terms of Use. ⦁ In order to provide our Services, we may
          share the Information with our third-party promotional and marketing
          partners, including, without limitation, businesses participating in
          our various programs. ⦁ We may, from time to time, share and/or
          license Information to other companies who may provide you information
          about the products and services they or their partners offer.
          <p></p>
          &nbsp;However, to the extent required by law, you will be given the
          opportunity to opt out of such sharing. ⦁ We may employ other
          companies and individuals to perform functions on our behalf.
          <p></p>
          &nbsp;Examples may include providing technical assistance, customer
          service, and marketing assistance.
          <p></p>
           &nbsp;These other companies will
          have access to the Information only as necessary to perform their
          functions and to the extent permitted by law. ⦁ In an ongoing effort
          to better understand our Visitors, Registered Users, and Services, we
          may analyze Information in aggregate form. 
          <p></p>
          &nbsp;This aggregate
          information does not identify you personally. 
          <p></p>
          &nbsp;We may share this
          aggregate data with our affiliates, agents, and business partners. We
          may also disclose aggregated user statistics in order to describe our
          Site and Services to current and prospective business partners and to
          other third parties for other lawful purposes. ⦁ We may share some or
          all of your Information with any of our parent companies,
          subsidiaries, joint ventures, or other companies under common control
          with us. ⦁ As we develop our businesses, we might sell or buy
          businesses or assets.
          <p></p>
           &nbsp;In the event of a corporate sale, merger,
          reorganization, sale of assets, dissolution, or similar event, the
          Information may be part of the transferred assets. ⦁ To the extent
          permitted by law, we may also disclose the Information: (i) when
          required by law, court order, or other government or law enforcement
          authority or regulatory agency; or (ii) whenever we believe that
          disclosing such Information is necessary or advisable, for example, to
          protect the rights, property, or safety of Baanthai or others.
          Information You Share Please keep in mind that whenever you
          voluntarily make your Personal Information or Registered User Content
          available to third parties — for example on message boards or web
          logs; through email; or in comment or chat areas — that information
          and content can be seen, collected, heard, and/or used by others
          besides us. 
          <p></p>
          &nbsp;We cannot be responsible for any unauthorized
          third-party use of such information or content, and this Privacy
          Policy does not apply to any Information that you share in any of the
          foregoing ways. How We Protect the Information We take commercially
          reasonable steps to protect the Information from loss, misuse, and
          unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction.
          <p></p>
          &nbsp;Please understand, however, that no security system is
          impenetrable. &nbsp;We cannot guarantee the security of our databases,
          nor can we guarantee that the Information that you supply will not be
          intercepted while being transmitted to and from us over the Internet.
          
          <p></p>
          &nbsp;In particular, e-mail sent to or from the Site may not be
          secure, and you should therefore take special care in deciding what
          information you send to us via e-mail. Children We do not knowingly
          collect Personal Information from children under the age of 13 through
          the Site. 
          <p></p>
          &nbsp;If you are under 13, please do not give us any
          Personal Information. &nbsp;We encourage parents and legal guardians
          to monitor their children’s Internet usage and to help enforce our
          Privacy Policy by instructing their children to never provide Personal
          Information through the Site without their permission.
          <p></p>
           &nbsp;If you
          have reason to believe that a child under the age of 13 has provided
          Personal Information to us, please contact us, and we will endeavor to
          delete that information from our databases. 
          <p></p>
